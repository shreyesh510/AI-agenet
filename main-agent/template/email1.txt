Subject: Need laptops for new team members - Urgent

Hi Team,

Hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out because we just hired 2 new developers and they need laptops ASAP. Our IT guy recommended your company for hardware purchases.

I'm looking to order 2 Laptops for them. We need something reliable for software development work. I saw on your website that you have some good options available.

Could you please process this order and have it delivered to our office? Here are the details:

Recipient: John Doe
Company: TechStartup Inc.
Address: 123 Innovation Drive, Suite 400, San Francisco, CA 94105
Phone: (415) 555-8234
Email: john.doe@techstartup.io

We're on a tight deadline since the new hires start next Monday, so expedited shipping would be great if possible. Please let me know the total amount and expected delivery date.

Also, do you offer any bulk discounts? We might need more equipment in the coming months as we continue to grow.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
John Doe

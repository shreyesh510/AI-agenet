Hey!

Thanks for getting back to me about the pricing. After discussing with my manager, we've decided to go ahead with the order.

So here's what we need:
- 3x Wireless Keyboard (the ergonomic ones you showed me)
- 2x Wireless Mouse

Our designers have been complaining about the old wired peripherals forever, so this should make them happy lol. The wireless setup will definitely help clean up their desks too.

You can reach me at sarah.miller@designagency.com or call me at 310-555-9821 if there are any issues with the order.

Oh and one more thing - could you include a receipt in the package? Our accounting department needs it for expense reports.

Thanks so much for your help with this!

Sarah
